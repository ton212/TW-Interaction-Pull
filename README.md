## Installation

3. Fill the `config.py` file with your information.

You will have to create your own app on [Twitter Dev](https://dev.twitter.com) to get the `Consumer key` and `Consumer secret` (if you want your DM to be pushed, you'll need yo give it permission to access your direct message) and request your **access token** for the `Access token` and `Access token secret`.

**Do not share your access token with anyone else!**
